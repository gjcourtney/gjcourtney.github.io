Each event is a starting point, but we would encourage you to keep thinking and processing what you've heard, asking the Holy Spirit what He is highlighting to you and what your next step in this journey should be.</p>

					<p>Why are adults always in a rush?</p>

					<p>There is no place to settle.
					<br>Resembling a ravine,
					<br>Just like a wondering thought (...)
					<br>It keeps going until it gets caught.
					<br>But, by that time it’s too late,
					<br>The action is unstoppable,</p>

					<p>It’s too fierce to stop.
					<br>Then looking behind; there’s hindsight, I can feel its burning eye sight,
					<br>Telling me “The outcome is not what you expected,”</p>

					<p>That which was once carefully protected.
					<br>Now neglected.
					<br>Shattered dreams is all we’re left with.</p>

					<p>Regret</p>

					<p>Regret starts defacing the words of life.
					<br>Heavy hearts absorb disappointment
					<br>The shrill wave of deferred hope
					<br>Everything it says makes sense,
					<br>We let regret set in,
					<br>We let regret stay,
					<br>We let regret have its way.</p>

					<p>There was one time...I felt empowered to speak my mind
					<br>To a room full of those I believed to be aligned.
					<br>I talked a vision that was whispered to me
					<br>In intimacy
					<br>And I revealed it all, so cheaply to see.
					<br>Like Joseph in his dreams
					<br>The ravine swept in
					<br>Now isolated I begin.</p>

					<p>I acted too hastily
					<br>I thought I heard him right!
					<br>I couldn’t wait for God to show up,
					<br>He takes ages!
					<br>But ... maybe I missed his timing.
					<br>I regret not trusting God.</p>

					<p>Standing in shame, through the fear of man,
					<br>He comes running as fast He can
					<br>To tell the truth
					<br>Words that will change your life!
					<br>He says, “Where are your accusers now?”</p>

					<p>Jesus breaks the tall walls of shame
					<br>Freedom floods the inner courts
					<br>The drench of grace covers all.</p>

					<p>Enter the throne room.
					<br>In His presence, I change my mind
					<br>He doesn’t fold his arms
					<br>He doesn’t say “I told you so”,</p>

					<p>With loving kindness, alone in his presence
					<br>He waits for me
					<br>He actually listens
					<br>To me.</p>

					<p>You see, regrets can be dealt with
					<br>Take a risk for God. Trust,
					<br>Place your heart on that unseen.</p>

					<p>Cast all your cares, leave it all behind
					<br>Look not to the left or the right
					<br>Only at His eyes.</p>

					<p>Every attempt to bring you down
					<br>Gets reversed by the one who wears the crown.
					<br>In this freedom; Rest and keep resting
					<br>Stand and keep standing
					<br>Walk and keep walking
					<br>Run and keep running
					<br>Regrets can lead to wisdom, risk is a part of learning
					<br>He will redeem it all.
					<br>Free people are dangerous.</p>
